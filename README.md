# Java Test Writing Playground 🧪

A repository for my Java practice exercises and mini-projects—focused on learning and demonstrating testing skills with JUnit 5, along with other Java essentials.

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside

This repo contains isolated code you can explore and learn from:


- **Junit** – Getting started with simple assertions and test lifecycle – Integrating Mockito in more complex scenarios. 
- **ShoppingCartWithTest** – Using parameterized tests to cover more use-cases – Creating your own JUnit 5 extensions for shared logic – Basic Mockito usage: stubs, spies, mocks.

## ⚙️ How to Run

Each subproject is a standalone Maven module. From the repository root run:

```bash
mvn clean test
````

You can also enter any subfolder individually and run its build:

```bash
cd junit5-parameterized
mvn test
```

## 🧪 Why This Repo?

* 📚 **Learning playground**: Try out new testing techniques, experiment with configurations, and get hands-on quickly.
* 🧩 **Modular & focused**: Each folder is self-contained: its build file, code, and tests make it easy to browse and understand.
